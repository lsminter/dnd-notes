Arix checks to see if he knows what a ghoul is... he does not. But he is ok with killing them. He checks to see if they are religious... he doesn't know... fascinating. 

South of us there are 2 dozen skeletons and armor scattered around the room. 

Strya and Aergo head into the room to scout it. I stay with Arix since he is the one with the torch. There is still a booming sound in the caves, but it is faint. 

## ROLL INITIATIVE

Some flying thingies sore down from the ceiling and attack Strya and Aergo. A winged creature with a long nose, bat like.

One of the bats gets stuck on Strya. Aergo casts a sleep spell right in front of her and put them all asleep. The one that was attached to Strya fell off. 

Droop moves up and pulls out his slingshot, or his thing depending on how you want to look at it. He shoots his shot and misses. 

I casually walk up to the two that are laying on the ground in front of me and I kill them both easily. 

Arix walks down to see what's going on. He pulls out his sword and gets ready incase any attack. 

Jon moves up and inspires Droop. 

Aergo does some crazy magic stuff and throws a blast of magics at the bats. She misses and it hits the back wall. The bats are lying on the ground. How do you miss?? 

Strya walks up to bash one with his sword. She kills it easily. 

Droop moves up next to me and shoots his slingshot at one and kills it. 

I walk up to the next one and swing my sword at it. Some dust got in my eye and I missed. It's fine cause I've already killed some. 

Arix moves up and tries to pick one of the sleeping bats up. He is accidentally too strong and crushes it in his hand. He is really sad by this. 

Jon move us and casts poison spray on the one next to him. During it's sleep, it starts gasping for breath and dies. 

Aergo carefully picks up one of the last two bats. She somehow stumbles and bumps it instead of picking it up and wakes it up. She freaks out. 

Strya walks up to the one that woke up and splatters it against her shield. 

Droop shoots at the last one with his slingshot but misses. 

I swing my sword at it and cleave it in half with my sword. Why do I have to do most of the work? 

Arix gets depressed looking at the blood and guts that cover his hands, the life that it once was, that he snuffed out so easily. He goes into an existential crisis. I comfort him and bring him back to reality. 

They are Sturges. Small beasts that Strya comes across often. 

We start to look around. I stick with Arix since he is the only one with the torch still. 

Jon's feet burped... 

Aergo and Strya move down a different path to me and Arix. Our path leads to two closed doors. Arix tells droop to go tell the other two that we are at a fork in the tunnel with two doors. 

Aergo sees some weird glowing slime. She throws a rock at it... The rock disappears right into the fungus in a cloud of "poof". They then meet back up with the rest of the group. 

Arix knows a lot about sea weed. 

I tell Arix to go knock on the door. He gives the torch to Strya. Aergo knocks on the other door at the same time.  I move up next to Aergo, Strya moves up next to Arix. We knock on the doors at the same time, neither of us get an answer. 

Arix flips a coin and we go through Aergo's door first. She tries to stealth open the door. Arix doesn't like to go in quietly and nudges her to open it faster. He is too strong and basically throws himself into her but Aergo opens the door slightly before this and is able to stand her ground against him. 

The room once was an office. There are three scales. There are papers and skeletons sprawled across the floor. Aergo finds an iron lock box sitting on one of the tables. 

Aergo attempts to pick the lock. She breaks one of her tools. She gets 'ragey' and attempts to open it with her bare hands and a knife. She fucks up really back and breaks the tip of her dagger. 

She calls for Arix to come and break it open for her. He swings his great axe at it and dents it. He swings again. He misses and hits the floor. He goes for one more big one. He brings his axe down and puts another dent in it. 

Jon tries to break the box. As Arix leave in shame, Jon throws it at the ground and coins spill everywhere. Aergo gives it all to Jon. (It's a decent amount of money) 

Aergo and I leave and she tries to sneakily open the other door. There is a big room. Splintered stone benches and rubble, there are bunks and bones of orcs and dwarves. 

Aergo sneaks in to the room and after a she reaches to the other side of the room, a bunch of skeletons rise up from the ground. 

## ROLL INITIATIVE

Droop walks in and pulls out his slingshot. She shoots at one and misses. The two skeletons closest to him attack back. The first one misses and the second one hits him with a sword. There is one further away that has a bow. 

Aergo pulls out her sword and attacks one of the skeletons next to her. The skeleton dodges the attack. 

Strya moves into the middle of the room recklessly and two of the skeletons attack her. One of the skeletons attack and miss. 

I drop both of my swords and pull out my bow and use my Seek Shot ability on the one next to droop. I action surge and attack the same skeleton again. The skeleton shatters into pieces. 

Arix runs in and uses his dragonborn breath on two skeletons in a row, the ones next to droop. 

The two skeletons next to Aergo and Strya drop their bows and bring out swords. It attacks Aergo but Strya gave them disadvantage. It misses. The second one attacks Strya and hits him. The other skeleton across the room shoots its bow at Aergo. She uses hellish rebuke on it and deals tons of damage. Another one shoots at Strya but misses. A skeleton with a sword moves up on Arix and attacks him but it glances off of his pex. The other one next to Arix attacks him and barely does anything. Droop gets attacked twice. One lands a decent hit on him and the other one misses. 

It's time for Jon to sit on some babies. He throws a knife made of ice at one of the skeletons next to Arix. He completely misses but everyone next to it takes and AOE attack from it. He gives Arix a small bit of sexual healing to make sure he is alright since he got hit in the AOE attack. 

Droop Tries to move away from the skeletons, they miss their attacks of opportunities. He shoots at one with his sling shot but misses. 

Aergo stabs the skeleton next to her. She inspires herself, how conceded, and blows up the skeleton with her smarts. 

Strya wide swings at the skeleton in front of her and bludgeons it. It bursts into splinters and bones. She moves next to another skeleton. 

I use my special trait to try and deal extra damage but it takes a ton of focus and while trying to shoot around Jon, I ever so slightly miss. 

Arix falls back so that only one skeleton is in front of him. 

Two skeletons attack Strya. Strya pulls up her shield in time and blocks both blows. One attacks Arix and barely pricks him. Another one attacks Strya and hits her.

Jon uses ice knife on the three skeletons in front of him. Arix uses his inner fire to not take any of the damage from the frost. He kills one and the other takes some frost damage. 

Aergo pulls out a dagger into her off hand and attacks the skeleton next to Strya with her sword in her main hand. She hit it with the sword and uses her bard magics to disintegrate it to dust. She throws her dagger from her off hand at the skeleton in front of Strya but barely misses. 

Strya nods in thanks towards Aergo. He bashes the skeleton in front of him with his shield and it shatters into many pieces. 

I shoot my arrow. I miss. 

Arix attacks the skele-man-boi in front of him. HE BRINGS UPON THE POWER OF HIS GOD AND DESTROYS THE SKELETON IN A BURST OF LIGHTNING AND RAGE! He then moves next to the skeleton next to Jon. 

The skelton in front of Jon misses. The other skeleton attacks Strya and hurts her a decent bit. She is struggling at this point. But Strya rises up and upper cuts the skeleton with her shield. 

Jon spews poison on the skeleton in front of him but it has no effect. 

Droop moves into position and hits the skeleton with his slingshot. IT DOES TONS OF DAMAGE. 

Aergo moves up and attacks the skeleton with her short sword. She blows it to smithereens. 

All of the skeletons are dead! Aergo searches for loot and found nothing of extreme value. Strya tends to Droop's wounds. I search for arrows but find none. Arix picks up Droop to make sure he is fine. I put away my bow and pick up my swords. I move into the room with the rest of the party. 

We move to the back of the room and take a short rest.
