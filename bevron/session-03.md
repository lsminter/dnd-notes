We go back into the cave and take a left. Arix climbs up first and the rest follow. 

Preston makes it collapse.

We continue under the bridge and fight three goblins. 

Again I do all of the work and kill everything. 

In the next room there are two goblins, a bug bear, and a grey wolf. 

I killed most everything and saved Preston and Jake. I guess Casey did things. 

We found some boxes and looted them, only got a health potion which we used on Moist Cabbage. 

LONG REST 

Crossed the bridge to fight some goblins. 

I saved a human from a goblin like a boss, still in combat. 

Finished killing everything. End of combat.
