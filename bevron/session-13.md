We are just outside of Old Owl Well after talking with Khast, the necromancer. 

We head out for Phandolin. 

On our way back, its been rainy and wet. A little muddy. Order, Casey, Jake, Me, Droop, Preston. 

We start to make camp in a clearing. I take first watch, then Casey, Preston, Jake. 

Nothing happens all night. 

We head out again. I stop to take a piss behind a tree. We get jumped by 5 goblins. I still have my dick out. 

I dodge two of the goblin’s attacks easily. Kawamori casts entangle on one of the goblins next to me. 

I draw both short swords and attack with both. He tanks the first one and by the power of the gods, a bolt of lightning comes down and hits in between us, making me miss my second swing. 

Kawamori bust out a magical shield and blocks damage coming towards him. 

Arix rages. 

Aergo yeets a dagger at the goblin in front of me. 

Wet Leaf sucked all of the water out of the goblin right in front of me and kills him. 

I thrust my sword into the goblin’s throat that next to me and kill him. I drop my swords and pull out my bow. 

Aergo casts hellish rebuke on a nearby goblin. She lights him afire and burns him alive. 

Arix harnesses the power of the gods and hits the goblin with a thunder smash!

Droop droppin bodies! 

All of the goblins are dead. I get a couple of super cool arrows from my buddy Arix. 

Aergo give Droop a beaver pelt. Gross. 

I fist bump him and shoot him with some finger guns.

We make camp and I sleep. Something happens. I don’t really care. I go back to sleep. 

We all wake up. 

I follow Arix to the water and clean off. 

I go back to camp and clean my armor and weapons. The lads come back with fish and we cook them up and eat them. 

We make it to Phandolin and head to the Temple. We tell the lady there that Sir Noth was the last one to have the book over 100 years ago. She gives me three vials of healing potions. 

She offers us a small prayer as we depart. 

I give Aergo and Droop a healing potion. 

We head to the weapon shop where Aergo tried to get beaver and we get Droop some leather armor. 

We head to the inn and try to get Droop drunk off ale. 

Aergo goes to get the leather and sneaks it into Droops bed. ;)

We sleep and do the stuff. 

We head out for Thundertree after much discussion on what place is closer. 

Never mind, people don’t fucking listen to me. We are actually heading to Never Winter taking the Highbore trail. 

The first night we make camp and get attacked by 6 wolves. 

I killed all of the wolves single handedly while the others slept. I was so quiet that no one even woke up.
