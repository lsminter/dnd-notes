We search the dead guys and I got the most money. 

Aergo got beaver. Mission successful. 

We go under into a new room and there are some special doors. Aergo goes to check them out and falls into a pit. I and the pirate dragon lower a rope and pull her up. 

We tie a rope around me and Arix throws me across. I’m too strong and jump into the door across the pit. I take 5 of the damage because I’m too strong. Arix jumps across. 

I open the door and bravely walk in first to shield everyone from danger. There is currently isn’t any danger and we all walk in. 

Aergo decides to walk forward and agro’s the Skeleton. What an incompetent bitch. 

I roll the highest out of everyone. I’m better than everyone again. All shall bow to me. 

I killed everything with my bow and arrows. Suck my penis. 

We roll initiative again. I’m fucking amazing. Better than everyone in the party. 

I dive in front of Arix and take a hit for him and take a ton of damage. I take a perfect shot at the bad guy and for some reason, Arix does a movie action dive and take the hit for him and goes unconscious since he grew an emotional connection with the guard. 

I kill the other guard. 

There are some women and a boy in cages near by. 

I punch the cage open to release the boy. The mother tries to seduce me but I turn her down for I am promised to another. 

The ladies and the boy are heading back to Phandolin because their original town got trampled to pieces. 

We walk back to the pit. Apparently you can walk around it. Aergo is a dingus and didn’t see it before.  

We head to the inn to sleep.
