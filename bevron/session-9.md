What color is droop??? Brownish-green. Like an olive green. 

Casey is going to use her devil magic and open the door by using the spell, “door-a-open”. 

Arix runs in! 

Human male reading a tome. He wears a mantle of… what the shit! He is holding a glass staff. 

Aergo tries to convince him that we are looking for a job. 

We back out of the room but the guy asks us how we knew about the entrance. 

The dragon tells him that Droop let us in. 

We roll initiative.  Someone swapped my dice with loaded dice before this. 

Preston is the biggest of the dinguses because he hasn’t been using his extra damage. 

Turns out the bad guy is Iarno and Sildar recognizes him. 

I deal a FUCK ton of damage. 

I dealt another fuck ton of damage. No one is as good as me! 

Iarno asks for mercy. We get to ask him questions. 

Turns out he is Glasstaff. 

Black spider is a drow. Sildar called him a traitor. 

Who else is in on this? He said he no one else from the Lords Alliance knows what he has done. 

He doesn’t know any of the Black Spider’s weaknesses. 

Where is the black spider? He sends the bug-bears from Wave Echo cave. He doesn’t know where that cave is. 

We check into a room. It’s got lots of cool stuff. 

Who is Ray? He is Glasstaff’s Rat. He is a familiar. 

Aergo spreads out everything evenly. 

I got two gems, 1 pearl worth 100g and 1 carnita worth 10g. 

Arix gives Droops silver and the two carnitas. Droops loves him much more than everyone else. 

We continue into the next room that appears to be a wizard workshop. 

We go back for the guy we left tied up in the chair. We leave back for the town. 

We got to town master’s hall with the tied up dood. 

Krogmaw Castle is our best bet to find Gundrin. 

Nundro and Thardon are still missing for weeks. 

Sildar leaves for Never Winter. 

We head to the store. 

Aergo loses the rat. 

I get rid of the crossbow and bolts and get my quivers full of arrows. 

Head to the tavern for food, drink and rest.
