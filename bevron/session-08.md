We follow Aergo into a hallway to check for peoples. 

I was under some enchantment, I blacked out, and took 3 damage. There must be some enchantress somewhere. 

Wet Leaf opens the door and it was a previous room with a pool that we have been in. 

We backtrack and go down a different hallway. 

We turn into a different door. There are three bug-bears and a single fainted goblin.

Aergo enchants the king dude. 

The dragon is inspired by the white boys. 

The dragon shrieks quite loudly and kills two of the bugga-bears. 

Aergo kills the last one. 
 
The goblin’s name is Droop. 

I FOUND SOME BOLTS! FUCK YEAH! 

Droop has been added to the party. 

I peek in with a set of dice. 

We play dice and tie one of them up with the loaded dice. 

The leaders are the black spider and Glasstaff.

Aergo sneaks in and throws a knife at one of them. 

I roll a 22 initiative. I’m the best. Ryann cheated and one of the bad guys rolled higher than me. 

I have them totally convinced that I am on their side. You’ll never lock out the real Napster. 

I punch the tied up one in the face to knock him out. He is surprisingly resilient. Punched him a couple more times. Decided to move on. 

Wet leaf starts to wrap the tied up guy in a web since he is a spider. 

Glasstaff runs the hideout. He is a mage and has a glass staff. He is hanging out down the hallway. 

Droop knows where a secret door is and is leading us to it.
