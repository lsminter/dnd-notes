# Megalovania starts playing

Arix is still surrounded by zombies. 

The flaming skull seems to be fluttering. 

I hold my ground and ready my bow to see if any bad guys come around the corner. 

Jon puts droop down Droop and transforms into a giant lizard. 

Arix dodges attacks LEFT and RIGHT! 

Aergo throws a dagger at the zombie closest to her. It embeds into the head of the zombie. 

Strya yells at us to leave then runs back to Arix and attacks the closest zombie. She cuts the jaw off of the zombie. 

Droop holds his ground and shoots a rock out of his sling at the nearest zombie.

Arix swings at the zombie closest to him and stabs it and it crumples to the ground. 

A zombie swings at Arix and he dodges it masterfully. 

The zombies move up and another takes it's place. 

The flame skull growls and unhinges it's jaw. Two lights come out of it's mouth and shoots two beams at Arix and one at Strya. They both get hit by it. It chuckles. 

I use seek shot and hit the fireball and deal a decent bit of damage. 

Jon moves up on the ceiling and bites at one of the zombies. He hit. 

A zombie moves up and tries to pass Arix but Arix hit's it with an attack of opportunity and kills it.

Aergo pulls out her crossbow and attacks the closest zombie but she is bad and misses. 

A zombie attacks Arix and misses. 

Another one attacks him and smacks it with it's arm but barely does anything. 

Strya bashes one of the zombies with her shield and does tons of damage. 

Droop shoots a zombie with his sling shot. 

Arix looks at the giant lizard on the wall and realizes it's Jon and says, "I told you to get droop to safety!" Then he attacks the zombie in front of him. He smashes it with his sword. The zombie doesn't seem too pleased. 

A zombie attacks Strya but misses. Another one attacks but misses. 

The fire skull shoots a light attack at all three in the cave and does damage to all of them. 

I shoot at the flame skull twice. It burns up one of my arrows but the other one hits. 

Jon uses a bonus action and becomes invisible and moves along the wall to get close to the flaming skull.
