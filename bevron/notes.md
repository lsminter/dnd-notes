Elmar Barthin from Elmar Barthin’s provisions store

Gundrin Rockseeker is missing, off to try and find him. 

At mouth of cave, encountered two goblins. I did everything again. No one is of any use to me in this group. 

Went into the cave, saw some wolves, kept on going.

Got washed out of the cave by water thrown down from the bridge up above. 

SHORT REST

END OF SESSION ONE

SESSION TWO START

We go back into the cave and take a left. Arix climbs up first and the rest follow. 

Preston makes it collapse.

We continue under the bridge and fight three goblins. 

Again I do all of the work and kill everything. 

In the next room there are two goblins, a bug bear, and a grey wolf. 

I killed most everything and saved Preston and Jake. I guess Casey did things. 

We found some boxes and looted them, only got a health potion which we used on Moist Cabbage. 

LONG REST 

Crossed the bridge to fight some goblins. 

I saved a human from a goblin like a boss, still in combat. 

Finished killing everything. End of combat. 

SESSION 2 END

SESSION 3 START

Sildar is the name of the man we saved. Was hired by the dude that hired us. 

Black Spider is the one that ordered Klarg to thwart Gundrin’s plans. 

Gnome and dwarves have a truce over a certain mine named Wave Echo Cave. Was overrun by orcs and goblins and the location was lost. Gundrin is searching for it. He has family ties to the cave. 

Stone Hill Inn in Phandolin. 

Get food and sleep. Leveled up. 

We go to collect our reward from Barthin at Barthin’s provisions. 

Nundro and Thardon are Gundrin’s brother that are looking for him. 

Red Brand Ruffians are causing trouble in the town. 

The Lion Shield Coster is the trading store with weapons. 

I buy studded leather armor and sell my leather armor. 

The owner said she last saw the ruffians on the Triboar Trail. 

Sleeping Giant is the is the taproom. There are 4 ruffians hanging outside. 

I fight them and kill 3. One runs inside and locks the metal door and the windows are boarded. 

END OF SESSION 3

START OF SESSION 4

We break into the taproom and I open the door for the rest of us. Make our way through the house. 

We chase the bad guy out the back for a long time. (too long)

There was an insane gust of wind that made my perfectly shot arrow go off course. It was completely out of my control and there was absolutely nothing I could’ve done. The wind won’t stop randomly blowing every time I shoot my arrows. 

I decided to let someone else do something and kill the bad guy. 

I search, got nothing. 

Sildar comes to us and is happy that I killed the bad guys but the town master is unhappy that “trouble” is being caused. (There are still people from the gang somewhere). His friend has gone missing. 

Sildar has joined the party. Iarno Albrek is Sildar’s friend that we are searching for. 

Aergo sneaks into the manor using the red cape. 

We go into the manor and search the downstairs. 

We find three bad guys in a small room. I rolled a 21 on initiative. Everyone else is inferior. 

I did tons of damage. All of the damage to the bad guys. Why does no one ever help me? 

I grab a red cloak from the wall along with the others. There is a red cloak in my inventory. Don’t forget about the red cloak. 

We are still in the basement. 

END OF SESSION 4

START OF SESSION 5

We search the dead guys and I got the most money. 

Aergo got beaver. Mission successful. 

We go under into a new room and there are some special doors. Aergo goes to check them out and falls into a pit. I and the pirate dragon lower a rope and pull her up. 

We tie a rope around me and Arix throws me across. I’m too strong and jump into the door across the pit. I take 5 of the damage because I’m too strong. Arix jumps across. 

I open the door and bravely walk in first to shield everyone from danger. There is currently isn’t any danger and we all walk in. 

Aergo decides to walk forward and agro’s the Skeleton. What an incompetent bitch. 

I roll the highest out of everyone. I’m better than everyone again. All shall bow to me. 

I killed everything with my bow and arrows. Suck my penis. 

We roll initiative again. I’m fucking amazing. Better than everyone in the party. 

I dive in front of Arix and take a hit for him and take a ton of damage. I take a perfect shot at the bad guy and for some reason, Arix does a movie action dive and take the hit for him and goes unconscious since he grew an emotional connection with the guard. 

I kill the other guard. 

There are some women and a boy in cages near by. 

I punch the cage open to release the boy. The mother tries to seduce me but I turn her down for I am promised to another. 

The ladies and the boy are heading back to Phandolin because their original town got trampled to pieces. 

We walk back to the pit. Apparently you can walk around it. Aergo is a dingus and didn’t see it before.  

We head to the inn to sleep. 

END OF SESSION 5

START OF SESSION 6

We wake up in the inn. 

We head to Barthon’s to possibly buy a potion depending on what is there. 

We go into the mansion. Moist cabbage slips going up the stairs like a doofas and takes damage. 

The wet leaf falls down the stairs again and knocks out a floor board. The fucking idiots that I have to deal with. 

We see Aergo fall down a GAPING hole. We see feet. That is all we see. There is nothing else to see but her feet from the fall from the top of the stairs to the FIRST floor. 

Sildar’s friend’s name is… OH MY GOODNESS… I believe its Iarno Albrek.

We head downstairs and I roll the highest out of everyone to get across the pit. 

Sillydar falls into the pit and takes tons of damage. He loses my rope. I expertly climb down into it and get my rope and climb back out just using my feet. 

We head through the coffin room and go past the prison room into a small room. 

There is a metal door that is locked. The dragon breaks the door open. There are tons of weapons. 

Apparently a normal person cannot carry more than three quivers. I have to hide my true abilities and only go with three even though I could easily go with 8 total quivers. 

I also grab a crossbow. 

Sildar finds a secret door and opens it. Kawamori goes through the door. 
 
We go through and Aergo go completely invisible and no one can see her. We wait for a scream, or a shit or a fuck. In that order. 
 
As we walk around, we find a Nothic. Usually untrusted. One giant eye. It is there to keep an EYE out. 
 
Aergo throws a dagger stealthily at it. It screams in each of our minds. 
 
ROLL INITIATIVE
 
The whole bridge shattered and Arix falls into the crevice. 
 
Ryann has loaded dice. 
 
ARIX PULLS OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE AND JUMPS ACROSS THE PIT AND GRAPLES THE BEAST! He does 3 damage… 
 
Arix pulls off the biggest coolest swing of his great axe and kills the beast!
 
Really wish that Casey did more damage. I did a lot. 

There are no bolts… or arrows… 

END OF SESSION 6

START OF SESSION 7

We follow Aergo into a hallway to check for peoples. 

I was under some enchantment, I blacked out, and took 3 damage. There must be some enchantress somewhere. 

Wet Leaf opens the door and it was a previous room with a pool that we have been in. 

We backtrack and go down a different hallway. 

We turn into a different door. There are three bug-bears and a single fainted goblin.

Aergo enchants the king dude. 

The dragon is inspired by the white boys. 

The dragon shrieks quite loudly and kills two of the bugga-bears. 

Aergo kills the last one. 
 
The goblin’s name is Droop. 

I FOUND SOME BOLTS! FUCK YEAH! 

Droop has been added to the party. 

I peek in with a set of dice. 

We play dice and tie one of them up with the loaded dice. 

The leaders are the black spider and Glasstaff.

Aergo sneaks in and throws a knife at one of them. 

I roll a 22 initiative. I’m the best. Ryann cheated and one of the bad guys rolled higher than me. 

I have them totally convinced that I am on their side. You’ll never lock out the real Napster. 

I punch the tied up one in the face to knock him out. He is surprisingly resilient. Punched him a couple more times. Decided to move on. 

Wet leaf starts to wrap the tied up guy in a web since he is a spider. 

Glasstaff runs the hideout. He is a mage and has a glass staff. He is hanging out down the hallway. 

Droop knows where a secret door is and is leading us to it. 


END OF SESSION 7


START OF SESSION 8

What color is droop??? Brownish-green. Like an olive green. 

Casey is going to use her devil magic and open the door by using the spell, “door-a-open”. 

Arix runs in! 

Human male reading a tome. He wears a mantle of… what the shit! He is holding a glass staff. 

Aergo tries to convince him that we are looking for a job. 

We back out of the room but the guy asks us how we knew about the entrance. 

The dragon tells him that Droop let us in. 

We roll initiative.  Someone swapped my dice with loaded dice before this. 

Preston is the biggest of the dinguses because he hasn’t been using his extra damage. 

Turns out the bad guy is Iarno and Sildar recognizes him. 

I deal a FUCK ton of damage. 

I dealt another fuck ton of damage. No one is as good as me! 

Iarno asks for mercy. We get to ask him questions. 

Turns out he is Glasstaff. 

Black spider is a drow. Sildar called him a traitor. 

Who else is in on this? He said he no one else from the Lords Alliance knows what he has done. 

He doesn’t know any of the Black Spider’s weaknesses. 

Where is the black spider? He sends the bug-bears from Wave Echo cave. He doesn’t know where that cave is. 

We check into a room. It’s got lots of cool stuff. 

Who is Ray? He is Glasstaff’s Rat. He is a familiar. 

Aergo spreads out everything evenly. 

I got two gems, 1 pearl worth 100g and 1 carnita worth 10g. 

Arix gives Droops silver and the two carnitas. Droops loves him much more than everyone else. 

We continue into the next room that appears to be a wizard workshop. 

We go back for the guy we left tied up in the chair. We leave back for the town. 

We got to town master’s hall with the tied up dood. 

Krogmaw Castle is our best bet to find Gundrin. 

Nundro and Thardon are still missing for weeks. 

Sildar leaves for Never Winter. 

We head to the store. 

Aergo loses the rat. 

I get rid of the crossbow and bolts and get my quivers full of arrows. 

Head to the tavern for food, drink and rest. 


END OF SESSION 8


START OF SESSION 9

talk to Qelline at Aldarleef, Daran Edermaff, town master, shrine 

We had a full breakfast and we got praise for getting rid of the Ruffians. 

How tall is droop? 3’2”

The inn keeper says that the hasn’t seen any dwarves except for the minor’s exchange. 

I head to the shrine with Aergo and Arix. It is dedicated to Temora(?). There is a young, female elf praying. Aergo is going for some beaver again. 

Aergo is getting chummy with the Elf. 

The elf has a mission. Agatha, there is a banshee outside of town that needs dealing with. she is said to know much about this world. we need to take a spellbook to her. We need to bring a jeweled silver comb to give to the banshee. Ask for the location of the spell book. the book is owned by Bo Gentle. North East, 2 Days travel. We get a map from her. She will bless us when we finish this task.

We meet up with wet leaf who is chatting with someone named Duran.  

He doesn’t know anything about Wave Echo Cave. There is dangerous magic happening east outside of town. We got a rough estimate of where Old Owl Well is, about a 2 days travel. Undead, the redead, stuff is happening. 

Banshee’s are vulnerable to arrows. Considered undead. 

THIS IS THE APPLE ORCHARD. WE GROW ORANGES. 

The average lifespan of the halfing is around 150 years. 

We head to a field nearby. There is an older lady halfling that is working out in the fields. 

Her name is Alderleaf. She says: There was a Kragmaw castle. 

Raydoth might know about the castle. Long time friend. An adventurer. He is in a village named Thundertree. A tough friend of her. Works alone. He just set out for Thundertree. She gives us a rough estimate written on a map. North West of us, close to Never Winter. 

Aergo hits droop in the head with an apple on purpose. 

Arix throws his half of an apple at Aergo. 

Aergo throws 5 illusionary apples that are on fire at Arix. Arix actually believes this is happening. He tries to dodge and barely does it in time. He trips and is now dirty. 

It’s still before midday. 

We decided to head North East after the healing potions are ready. We decided to go after the banshee. 

We are going to wait for the health potions to finish brewing. I’m going to an archery range to practice archery. I get an advantage the next time I fight from my training. 

We go to sleep. 

We head out for the banshees place. We make camp after a day’s travel. I take second watch. 

I’m sleeping and have to roll initiative. A group of goblins are attacking us.  Aergo’s flute woke us up as she puts two of the goblins to sleep. Aergo turns a goblin into flames and he dies. 

DROOP IS FIGHTING WITH US! 

I deal tons of damage with my bow and kill one of the goblins. 

Other people are doing things, doesn’t really matter to be honest. 

I didn’t miss a single shot this fight. I’m so fucking good. Fight over. 

We go back to sleep and nothing happens for the rest of the night. 

Wet leaf just slaps the fire out of existence. 

It gets harder to travel. The bushes are getting thicker. 

Night comes and the night goes by uneventfully. 

We start walking and find a sign that says “Connie” or “Berry”. 

We make it to a ruined village that is very overgrown by nature. 


END OF SESSION 9 



START OF SESSION 10

We enter a house. Its very DANK in there. 

An elf comes into view in front of us. She is very angry. An elf banshee. 

Aergo tries to charm her. Doesn’t work. Aergo gives her the comb. 

She smiles and takes the comb. She is a happy banshee now. 

We ask about the spellbook. Sir Noth now owns the book. He is from Aerabor. Over 100 years ago. 

We decide to head back till we can find a way south towards Old Owl Well. 

I ask Droop what sex Droop is. He is a dood. He identifies as boy droop. 

We travel till night and sleep. Watch order, Aergo, me, Arix, Wet leaf. 

A sword appears in Arix’s face apparently during his watch. 

There are four hobgoblins in our camp. 

I get shot and woken up. 

Arix yells very loud, “Vol is fire!” and uses his dragon breath and rages. 

He wakes up Aergo and Wet Leaf. 

Droop RAAAWRS and shoots his sling and kills a hobgoblin!!!

We kill all 4 of the hobgoblins. I got 6 arrows! 

Arix is a wanted person. The Black Spider is offering 25g for him. 

We finish our sleep. 

People are being mean to me… 

We are heading South now. 

We happen upon a run down tower. There is a tent set up. It’s a big tent is bright blue with some yellow. Something seems out of place. Things smell rotten. We hear some moaning. Around the watch tower, 12 zombies appear! Aergo isn’t in a good spot. 

WE FIGHT!

We are doing some fighting. I’m trying my best, I promise… 

A man leaves the tent amidst the zombies. 

He stops the zombies and waves them back. 

We were sent here by Daren to look for strange magical happenings that were happening. (It seems he is the source of the magic happenings)

There are a bunch of orcs at Wyvern Toll that have been bothering him and killing his zombies. He wants us to deal with them. He knows nothing of Bo Jangle’s books. 

He knows of Aerabor. He knows not where Wave Echo Cave is. 

The guy is here to look for the Arcain happenings as well. 

There is a well in the middle of town. 

His name is Kost. 

The orcs are south of us. 

He apparently recognizes the banshee. He wants to know the name of the wizard that built Old Owl Well. He isn’t willing to fight a banshee. He doesn’t want to appease her. He winks at Aergo’s for her dumb jokes. 

Wet leaf asks about The Gauntlet. They are adventurers, old, trying to stay relevant. 

He wants to know about the wizard cause this place is rumored to be an old magical empire built by this wizard. He gives us a map towards to Wyvern Toll. 

Arix says, “Guys, I think he was a necromancer.” Droop looks surprised. 

We go to check out the well on our way through town to the orcs. 

We come across some Orcs and Arix yells, “Hey!” 

We walk up slowly to the cave with Arix leading. He goes up to the cave and yells, “Hello!”

There are six orcs and an Ogre. They want to fight. 


END OF SESSION 10


START OF SESSION 11

We roll initiative. 

Kawamori casts the thorn ground spell. 

Droop is hit in the shoulder with a spear! but he is ok! 

He gets up from the ground and pulls out the spear. He brings out his sling shot and did a fuck ton of damage to the orc. 

STUFF HAPPENED 


END OF SESSION 11


START OF SESSION 12

We are just outside of Old Owl Well after talking with Khast, the necromancer. 

We head out for Phandolin. 

On our way back, its been rainy and wet. A little muddy. Order, Casey, Jake, Me, Droop, Preston. 

We start to make camp in a clearing. I take first watch, then Casey, Preston, Jake. 

Nothing happens all night. 

We head out again. I stop to take a piss behind a tree. We get jumped by 5 goblins. I still have my dick out. 

I dodge two of the goblin’s attacks easily. Kawamori casts entangle on one of the goblins next to me. 

I draw both short swords and attack with both. He tanks the first one and by the power of the gods, a bolt of lightning comes down and hits in between us, making me miss my second swing. 

Kawamori bust out a magical shield and blocks damage coming towards him. 

Arix rages. 

Aergo yeets a dagger at the goblin in front of me. 

Wet Leaf sucked all of the water out of the goblin right in front of me and kills him. 

I thrust my sword into the goblin’s throat that next to me and kill him. I drop my swords and pull out my bow. 

Aergo casts hellish rebuke on a nearby goblin. She lights him afire and burns him alive. 

Arix harnesses the power of the gods and hits the goblin with a thunder smash!

Droop droppin bodies! 

All of the goblins are dead. I get a couple of super cool arrows from my buddy Arix. 

Aergo give Droop a beaver pelt. Gross. 

I fist bump him and shoot him with some finger guns.

We make camp and I sleep. Something happens. I don’t really care. I go back to sleep. 

We all wake up. 

I follow Arix to the water and clean off. 

I go back to camp and clean my armor and weapons. The lads come back with fish and we cook them up and eat them. 

We make it to Phandolin and head to the Temple. We tell the lady there that Sir Noth was the last one to have the book over 100 years ago. She gives me three vials of healing potions. 

She offers us a small prayer as we depart. 

I give Aergo and Droop a healing potion. 

We head to the weapon shop where Aergo tried to get beaver and we get Droop some leather armor. 

We head to the inn and try to get Droop drunk off ale. 

Aergo goes to get the leather and sneaks it into Droops bed. ;)

We sleep and do the stuff. 

We head out for Thundertree after much discussion on what place is closer. 

Never mind, people don’t fucking listen to me. We are actually heading to Never Winter taking the Highbore trail. 

The first night we make camp and get attacked by 6 wolves. 

I killed all of the wolves single handedly while the others slept. I was so quiet that no one even woke up. 

END OF SESSION 12


START OF SESSION 13

We make it to the large open gate of Never Winter and the Good Knights Inn. 

We head to the inn for food and drink. This is where we started our journeys. 

There are lots of adventureers. There is a symbole that we havent seen before on someones robes. Kawamoury goes to speek to them and comes back to us. They are the druids of Never Winter. 

The tear in the realm needs immediate attention and he leaves us. 

There is someone sitting at a table all alone. Aergo goes and convinces him to join our team. 

He is a tall bearded blunt nosed looking humaniod, grey stoney skin, red hair Firbolg. He tries to go sit on Arix. He is 10.5’ tall. His name is Jondrathron. The most normal name ever. No fear from him. He just wants to sit on the baby. 

He notices Droop and He casts a spell on himself to make himself look like a goblin. He scares droop more. 

I’m just hanging out having a beer watching this all go down. 

To become invisible, just think really hard about not being here according to the tall one. 

The bard tries to do the same thing. She drops a smoke bomb that basically didn’t work and she tried to sneak around us but we all saw her very very very very easily. 

We had a way too long of a discussion about the word, “snigger”. 

Sildar’s guild is here in Never Winter. But Radoff is in Thundertree. 

We decide to head out to look at the weapon shops. There is one that is ran by a dwarf. 

I ask if he has anything magical weaponwise for archers. He has none and suggests that there is another weapons smith down the street that should have some for a high price. 

The bard tricks the shop owner into thinking that she was getting married to Jon. He sells her a thieving toolkit for a discounted price. 

We head out to go for the other weapons shop that should have magical weapons. An older leady runs the shop and is talking with other customers currently. Everything is under lock and key. 

Never Winter is a port town, very large. Arix and droop head to the port. 

The shop owner has acid arrows. I buy 5 for 80 gold. 

[ACID ARROWS- On hit, the target takes 1d8 acid damage and must pass a 15DC con saving throw or suffer -2 to their AC and have disadvantage of con saving throws for 3 rounds (does not stack)]
