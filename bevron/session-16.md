We just finished slaying the dragon. 

Arix chops the head off of the dragon and takes the tooth as a trophy. 

There is nothing upstairs. We head back to Radoth. It's early afternoon.

Radoth looks like a bush/green octopus. 

Radoth is cooking food for us over a fire and there is a hooded figure in the corner. Dorned in silver armor and long dark hair. 

Arix squeezes the head into the cabin. 

Aergo chats it up with the only other female here. Figures. 

Radoth looks at us - "Ya'll look like shit"

Arix whips the dragon head around and mimes with the head saying, "Not even a problem". Droop lmao's 

Aergo asks if we are going on a road trip. 

Radoth - what do you want with this acurside mine? 

Aergo - we want to do what is right. 

Radoth - what is right? 

a - we are trying to save a sole. 

r - what sole? 

a - We are seeking Gudren. 

r - I'll take you but I won't follow you in there. I don't believe Gundren has even found the cave. 

a - I think bad people kidnapped him to help them find it. 

Radoth looks over, these are the people you've been looking for. 

Paladin - You are very reliable. Thank you.

Jon finds a corner to go take a nap. 

a - hey, so what's your deal. 

p - thank you for saving my town from the redbrands. I had to watch as they destroyed my town, but you saved us. 

a - is your family ok? 

p - yes, they are recovering fine. I figured I would also hopefully be able to join you guys and, uh, learn and help other towns from no, uhhh, naydoers, at the very least help your journeys. Since you are looking for Gundren....

a - do you know him? 

p - not personally. Since you are on the path of good, I would like to follow you. 

a - are you native to thundertree? 

p - Yeah. I don't know anywhere else. 

ME - What's your name? 

p - My name is Strya Grysfellen. 

a - what mad eyou come here? There aren't any worriers or adventureers. 

S - clearly, certain places are unable to defend themselves. 

a - Congrats! Welcome to the group. 

She slaps them on the shoulder. 

Strya walks to Jon, who is sleeping in the corner, and she kneels next to him and heals him.

Jon goes over to droop and puts him on his shoulders and changes into a pony. 

R - if you are looking for gundren, he wont be at the cave. 

a - we want to stop the bad guys that are looking for the cave. 

r - i know who took Gundren. 

a - WHO TOOK HIM??? 

r - That's why I'm out here. My main mission is to keep the ballance between the city and the wilds. His brothers needed him. 

a - Nundro and Thardon? Those two. 

r nods his head.

We head off to wave echo cave after Arix picks up Aergo because she won't stop arguing. Aergo dodges around Arix. We let Radoth pack up. 

Aergo shall now be refered to as Bardo. 

We travel about four days towards Phandolin. 

We get to the base of a mountain range. It was all safe travels because of Radoth. The path now is more narrow, rocky, and steep. There is a small entrance that Radoth is clearing the way through. The entrance is smaller than Arix and he will have to bend of to make it through. 

r - This is where I stop. 

Arix - is there like some way that we can be assured that this is wave echo cave? 

Jon - Goodbye Radoth! Thank you for the walk! 

Jon turns himself into a human that is still 8 feet tall to try and fit into the cave easier. 

The tunnel is only 4 feet tall. 

The entrance leads into a large cave with three stalagtite. Flower, salt, salted meet, lanterns, oil, shovels, pickaxes. There is a body of a dwarf miner dead at least a week. There was a collapse. A rope is tied off and leads down the pit. 

Arix lights up a torch. Strya covers the body with a blanket after Arix attempts to identify the dwarf body. 

We can hear the sounds of slightly booming echos further on in the cave. Arix doesn't appear to know the dwarf. 

Aergo goes to try and climb down the rope. There is an entrance on either side of the pit. 

I slightly slip while climbing up the cliff but catch myself. Jon climbs up and helps people up on the cliff to the other side. 

I make it down to the other side with no issues at all. 

Arix tries to make a flip onto the other side and barely lands it. 

Aergo gets upset about just having to watch. 

Jon makes it safely down to problem. 

Aergo looks down through one hole and Arix checks out the other side. I follow Arix. 

We decide to turn back to stick with the rest of the party. We flip a coin to see what path to go down. The coin falls underneath the bed apparently. 

I'm the best and figure out which way to go. 

Aergo walks up to the door and checks it out. She attempts to open the door but spontaneously combusts! 

Strya shoves past Aergo and opens the door. 

I make sure to pull my swords out and my bow is strung on my back. 

Inside of this room, there are bones of dwarves and orcs. There are three hooded figures inside. 

We roll initiative! 

Jon moves up to the door. Lot's of stuff is happening and I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the room. 

There is no room for me to move into the room so I stand by ready to fight. 

Arix RAGES and prepares to fight! He throws his torch into the back of Jon. He then does an insane slide through the legs of Jon and into the room. 

I move up and swing my sword down on the baddie infront of Strya and deal tons of damage. He dodges my second attack. 

Now that I'm in the room, I can see what is happening. 

Arix has one of the guys attached to his arm. He pulls out his long sword and thrust it through his neck but he pulls to the side, so Arix misses the jugular. 

Droop bring out his sling shot and shoots at the guy next to him. Both Gouls missed their attacks on Droop because he is too fucking awesome. 

Jon runs past them and dodges the attack of one of the Gouls. He attacks the one that grapples Arix with his sickle and barely misses. 

Aergo shots some strange spell at the one of the Gouls. The goul is barely hanging on. 

Strya runs away and runs back! No ones knows as to why... She is just running in circles like a chicken with its head cut off. She swings at the goul in front of her and misses. 

The other goul tries to grab Droop but he shrugs it off no problem. 

I swing my sword at the goul again! I cut him in half with relative ease! 

I did the same to the other one as well. 

Man these fights are so easy. I just have to kill everything for this group.... It's so aggravating... 

Strya heals those that are in need of some healing. 

Arix still has the dragon head. I don't care what anyone else says. He still has it with him. He carried it with him up the cliff and through the tunnels. Everyone else is wrong.
