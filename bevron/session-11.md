We enter a house. Its very DANK in there. 

An elf comes into view in front of us. She is very angry. An elf banshee. 

Aergo tries to charm her. Doesn’t work. Aergo gives her the comb. 

She smiles and takes the comb. She is a happy banshee now. 

We ask about the spellbook. Sir Noth now owns the book. He is from Aerabor. Over 100 years ago. 

We decide to head back till we can find a way south towards Old Owl Well. 

I ask Droop what sex Droop is. He is a dood. He identifies as boy droop. 

We travel till night and sleep. Watch order, Aergo, me, Arix, Wet leaf. 

A sword appears in Arix’s face apparently during his watch. 

There are four hobgoblins in our camp. 

I get shot and woken up. 

Arix yells very loud, “Vol is fire!” and uses his dragon breath and rages. 

He wakes up Aergo and Wet Leaf. 

Droop RAAAWRS and shoots his sling and kills a hobgoblin!!!

We kill all 4 of the hobgoblins. I got 6 arrows! 

Arix is a wanted person. The Black Spider is offering 25g for him. 

We finish our sleep. 

People are being mean to me… 

We are heading South now. 

We happen upon a run down tower. There is a tent set up. It’s a big tent is bright blue with some yellow. Something seems out of place. Things smell rotten. We hear some moaning. Around the watch tower, 12 zombies appear! Aergo isn’t in a good spot. 

WE FIGHT!

We are doing some fighting. I’m trying my best, I promise… 

A man leaves the tent amidst the zombies. 

He stops the zombies and waves them back. 

We were sent here by Daren to look for strange magical happenings that were happening. (It seems he is the source of the magic happenings)

There are a bunch of orcs at Wyvern Toll that have been bothering him and killing his zombies. He wants us to deal with them. He knows nothing of Bo Jangle’s books. 

He knows of Aerabor. He knows not where Wave Echo Cave is. 

The guy is here to look for the Arcain happenings as well. 

There is a well in the middle of town. 

His name is Kost. 

The orcs are south of us. 

He apparently recognizes the banshee. He wants to know the name of the wizard that built Old Owl Well. He isn’t willing to fight a banshee. He doesn’t want to appease her. He winks at Aergo’s for her dumb jokes. 

Wet leaf asks about The Gauntlet. They are adventurers, old, trying to stay relevant. 

He wants to know about the wizard cause this place is rumored to be an old magical empire built by this wizard. He gives us a map towards to Wyvern Toll. 

Arix says, “Guys, I think he was a necromancer.” Droop looks surprised. 

We go to check out the well on our way through town to the orcs. 

We come across some Orcs and Arix yells, “Hey!” 

We walk up slowly to the cave with Arix leading. He goes up to the cave and yells, “Hello!”

There are six orcs and an Ogre. They want to fight.
