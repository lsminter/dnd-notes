This is Thundertree

Arix opens his chest he got form the trap door. 700c 160s 90g is in the chest. 

140c 32s 18g for each of us, including Droop. 

Aergo heads to the cottage next to us. Not sure what she saw in there but it must've not been too interesting since she left. 

We head down the road to see what's going on. 

Aergo walks up to a new cottage and peers into the window. 

Jon attempts to slips into the cottage as after turning himself into a ferret. The doors are too stuck. 

Aergo tries to punch open a window with a dagger. She stabs wood. Not cut herself with glass. 

Aergo tries to get Arix to open the door. He suggests knocking! She lies and told him that she already tried that. He walks up to the door and knocks on it. Nothing happens. He jiggles the handle. It's a very tight door. It's swollen. He kicks the door and it barely budges it. He shoulder checks the door and it barely budges again. He shoulder checks the door one more time and blasts through the door and falls into the cottage. 

There is a human archer inside. Aergo jumps over Arix and kneels down, bows, and says, "We are here to help you!"

He asks, "What kind of help are you offering me."

Aergo says, "We are for higher, whatever you need!"

He looks at her and puts his bow/arrow down. 

Aergo - "What are you doing here? There is nothing here but bad guys except you."

Archer - "Research"

Aergo - "Did you used to live here before everything?"

Archer - "Traveler"

Aergo - So are we! 

Archer - "What are you doing here."

Aergo - "We are also researching and looking for answers." 

Archer - "How do you know of this place?"

Aergo - "We saved some people that told us about his place."

Archer - "Its been a long time since people have been here."

Aergo - "We figured we would stop here. We are looking for Radoth."

Radoth - "How do you know of me?"

a - "Alderleaf sent us."

r - "Alright.

a - she has a lot of tasty apples

r - be careful, there are quite a bit of plant monsters. go south to the ruins there, there are spiders. Theres also been a lot of people traveling here recently, black masks and cloaks. 

a - Have you seen any emblems on their cloathing? 

r - not really, wings possibly. 

a - what answers are you looking for here? 

r - just traveling and looking around. there is one nuisance here. on the path north. there is a nuisance in the tower there that i need to get rid of. a young green dragon. praying on the innocence. 

Jon turns back into a humaniod again. Radoth understands as he is a druid as well. 

R - why are you here again? 

a - knowledge, black spider gang, wave echo cave. 

r - knows nothing about hte black spider gang. he has seen waveecho cave. 

a - how about we help you with the dragon and you tell us about wave echo cave? 

r - you've got yourself a deal! I will take you wave echo cave if you do that. I won't help against the dragon. 

a - anything we should be weary about? 

r - besides its a dragon? 

a - gotcha... 

We head out north for the dragon. Aergo scouts ahead. There is a tower and a cottage attached to it. Both are in good condition. Half of the tower is gone. There is a eire quite sound in the area. There are dead bodies. We decide to take a nap before continuing. 

Arix goes to ask Radoth when the dragon is active during the day/night. He says there isn't much of a schedule. 

We go to take a nap and had a waaaaay too long discussion about healing when most of us were full hp or could easily roll to full hp. 

Aergo feeds her ferret. 

The doors and windows are locked. Arix kicks the door way the fuck down. There is a very loud crash. 

In draconic, Arix says, "SORRY ABOUT YOUR DOOR!" We hear nothing. 

Arix goes in. Aergo slips past him and enters first. 

There are a lot of cobwebs. It's damp and dark. The floor has a bit of rubble on it. Nothing out of the ordinary. There is a door off to the side, the back of the cottage and the tower. 

Aergo goes to open the door in the back. It's stuck. She slams her shoulder into the door. She pops the door open. It's just the back yard... 

Arix knocks on the door to the tower. Aergo enhances his knocking and makes it very loud. It echos throughout the tower. Arix is surprised. He looks at his arm and starts flexing. We hear nothing. He jiggles the handle with the other hand scared of breaking the door. The doorknob is broken but the door is still swollen from water. 

Jon starts pulling the water out of the door. He pulls the water out and the door starts to shrivel and after about 5 minutes, we are able to open the door. 

Arix opens the door and walks in closely followed by Aergo. We head in. There is not much of a celling. There are stairs going up around the walls. There are pillars around the room for holding up the celling that isn't much there anymore. 

There is a broken pillar off to the side. We hear a very sudden and large roar at the top of its lungs. We hold our ears. THE DRAGON SWOOPS IN THROUGH THE CELLING! The green dragon appears before us. 

Roll initiative! 

He spews out this putrid green gas from his mouth. The dice is hiding behind Ryann. 

He dealt a fuck ton of damage to all of us. Aergo, Jon, and I are down. 

#REWIND

We are all alive. 

Jon enhances Arix. And runs behind the south west pillar. 

Aergo uses her flute to cast Cloud of Daggers on the dragon then runs up the stairs behind the south east pillar. 

Arix rages. His kind of Dragon is racist. They don't like this kind of dragon. He runs to the dragon and hits it with his sword. 

The dragon attacks Arix. And does a good bit of damage. The dragon moves to the center of the room. 

I move behind the pillar next to droop and Jon. Then I use my seeking shot and hit the dragon. 

Jon looks really hard at the dragon. It's apparently a dragon. He uses Ice Dagger on the dragon, misses, but the explosives deals a decent bit of damage to the dragon. 

Aergo did something. I wasn't paying attention. 

Arix moves back away from the dragon and runs towards the dragon and tries to leaps on top of it. He makes it! He goes to stab the dragon and plunges his sword into the back of the dragon. He falls onto his back, still on the dragon, leaving his sword in the back of the dragon. 

The dragon starts moving and Arix falls off of the dragon but sticks the landing.

He uses his poison breath on Jon, Droop, and me. 

We get hit by the gas and I pass out. 

I wake up to Jondrathon healing me. 

Aergo Deals a little damage and gives Jon some inspiration. 

Arix pulls out his great axe and recklessly attacks the dragon. He misses. 

The dragon attemps to take the sword out of his back but is unable to. He swang his paw at Jon and and hits him. 

Droop fails his saving throw. 

I shoot my banishing shot at him but the dragon saves himself. I still deal damage. 

Jon picks up Droop and runs away with him. 

Aergo whispers irratically. 

Arix walks up and attacks the dragon with his great axe. The dragon now attacks him and deals a good bit of damage. 

I dramatically pull out from around the pull and draw my bow with my acid arrow and pull back on my bow, the arrow glistening in the light peering through the cealing. As I loose the arrow, it pierces the eye of the dragon, killing it. 

Arix runs to Droop to check on him. Jon uses his magic powers to save him. 

Acid seems to work well against the poison dragon.
