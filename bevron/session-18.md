We wake up from our short rest. 

Arix goes back into one of the other rooms to look through the books. 

The books were enchanted by a dark sorcerer and bursted into flames when he touched them. (He wasn't very believable.)

He apparently was lying and the books would crumble into dust when picked up. He picked up several. 

We talk about the fungi that Aergo threw a rock at earlier. We decide to not go towards the glowing mushrooms and walk north from the two rooms. Droop is the one with the torch. 

Aergo creeps around the corner to see what's there. Just more hallways. 

Aergo tickles Arix for some reason and we move on. It's just caverns and hallways. Nothing else so far. 

Aergo keeps leading us. A big ooze drops down in front of us! I shoot it with my bow and fuck it up hard!

Arix pulls out his great axe and lightly swing it at the ooze. He cuts it in half. Now there are two oozes!

Strya moves up in front of the oozes to block whatever damage comes his way. 

Droop moves up to deal some damage! He shoots it with his sling shot.

The ooze attacks Strya but just bumps off of his shield. 

The other ooze climbs up the wall but Strya smashes it with his shield. It keeps on going and stands next to Arix. 

John uses a spell that conjures up a whip and he uses it on the ooze but misses terribly. 

Aergo uses Eldritch Blast on one of the oozes and hits it and deals a moderate amount of damage. 

I shoot the ooze nearest me. I'm so good. 

Arix pulls out his Greataxe and deals a ton of damage to the ooze nearest to him and it dissolves into the ground. 

Strya smashes his shield into the ooze next to him. It wabbles but is still in tact. 

Droop shoots the ooze with his sling shot and it hits. He uses FURY OF THE SMALL and the ooze explodes! 

Droop and I high five! 

Arix tries to pick up the ooze and it starts to burn his hand. 

John leans down to listen to a rock and it says "this one thinks that arix is cute"

Arix keeps the rock. 

Strya leads the way this time to give Aergo a rest and be in a more defensible position. 

Aergo decides to take the lead after a big because she can be more stealthy. She can hear the echos of the waves throughout the cave. 

There are lumps on the ground. Turns out it is just rocks. Aergo inspects the rocks but finds rocks. 

Arix looks up. It's a ceiling. 

We keep going and end up upon a pool of water. 

Jon says to Arix, "The water thinks you're cute too".

There are some stairs near by. Aergo goes to check it out. 

Arix sees that the water goes through a small tunnel. He starts to wade into the water to see if he can look into it. He goes under the water to see what is in there. There is something shiny. Aergo senses that there is something magical in the water. 

Droop grabs Arix's great sword and shield for him. 

Arix dives down into the water. There is a skeleton with some fancy stuff. 

Arix comes back up and is super spooked. The human body contains enough bones to make a whole skeleton. 

Two rings are on one hand and the wand is the other hand. Droop puts on the rings and looks super fly. The wand apparently magical. 

Jon starts walking up the stairs. There is a door in front of us. Arix knocks. There were some voices heard on the inside. 

I pull out my sword and don the red cloak. There are old stone bunks and an iron brazier in the middle of the room. There is a door on the opposite end of the room. There are 5 bugabears and I ask if they fancies a game of dice. They responded in the negative. 

## ROLL INITIATIVE

One of the bugabears rolls up and throws a spear at me. He misses and hits the wall next to me. 

Strya moves in front to protect me.

Arix moves into the room and rages. He swings his sword at the closest enemy. 

The next enemy moves up next to Strya. He swings his morning star at Strya and hits. 

Droop moves into the room. 

Jon moves into the room and casts flame blade! He swings his sword at one of the enemies. He hits with a decent big of damage. 

An enemy moves up and attacks Jon. 

I drop my sword and pull out my bow and shoot the man next to Arix. I shoot another arrow at the same man. I hit both times. 

Another enemy rolls up on Arix and misses his attack. 

Aergo attacks one of the enemies next to Arix and hits him and dies. 

Strya destroys ones of the other enemies and grapples it. 

Arix fucks up another ones of the bugabears. 

The grappled bear tries to ungrapple himself from Strya but is still grappled. 

Droop does pretty much nothing. 

Jon casts thorn whip on one of the bugabears but misses. 

I shoot one of the bears. I'm too good. 

Arix attacks one of the dudes next to him that's attacking someone else. But he misses. 

Aergo throws her dagger at a dude and hits the guy. 

Strya punches a dude in front of him. 

Arix tries to knock a dude unconscious but misses his attack. He sticks his tongue out at the bear. 

The bear is still grappled. 

Droop shoots at the one next to Arix but misses. 

Jon tries to whip the dude next to him but does not hit... 

Strya dodges an attack from the dude next to him. 

I shoot and miss. I hang out. 

A bear tries to attack Arix but Strya makes him miss by shoving his shield in the way just in time. 

Aergo heats up the weapon of one of the baddies. It is mildly annoying. 

Arix gets his buy a bad dude. 

Strya knees one of the bad guys right in the groin. He shatters the bugbear's pelvic bone. 

Arix attacks the dude below him and deals massive damage trying to knock him unconscious. The body falls to the ground be is unsure if he is alive or dead. 

Droop Shoots at the dude in front of Arix and misses. 

Jon attempts, once again, to cast thorn whip on the dude next to him. He pulls it closer to him. It tries to attack Jon but Strya gets in the way a little bit but not enough. 

I shoot and miss. 

Some stuff happens, people did some things, we wipe the baddies, I get my arrows back! WOOHOO

Strya moves to the back of the room and listens at the second door to see if there is anything there. He hears faint moaning, unsure if it is "good" or bad moaning. 

The "unconscious" bear turns out to be a dead bear. 

Strya starts to unbaricade the door at the back of the room. 

I stay next to the fire to stay warm. 

Strya manages to clear the barricade and walks in very stelthily. There are three baddies right there but we can still hear the moaning. 

There is stuff happening to Droop and Arix but I don't know what is happening. 

## Cat got sick, Stopped taking notes.
