There is a second droop in the room with us. We are in a fight with some buggabears. 

One buggabear swings a sword at Arix and misses. 

Arix runs away like a pansy. 

Strya uses Sacred Weapon and then just hangs out. 

"Droop" flees away over the water. 

Arix attacks "Droop" with his sword and hurts him severely! *gasp*

AERGO ALSO ATTACKS "DROOP" WITH ELDRITCH BLAST! I wonder why they are being so mean to him. He must've said something. 

A buggabear runs up to me and I block it masterfully. I banish him to the shadow realm and regroup with the others. I shoot an arrow at the other buggabear but water drops from the ceiling in my eyes and I barely miss.

The other "Droop" was crying and missed his attack. 

Jon casts thunderwave around him while he is stood next to the buggabear. The buggabear does the thing and takes half damage. Jon uses a good boi moon point to gain some HP. 

The buggabear attacks Jon. As he swings his big morning star down, Jon gleefully glides past it. 

Arix is still raging, anger in his eyes. He ends his rage and picks up one of the "Droops" to see if he is ok. 

I look at Arix, and notice their loving exchange and realize that must be the real Droop for why else would our dragon hug another Droop. 

Strya runs to the buggabear next to Jon and attacks it but barely misses. 

Aergo moves up to get vision of the droop that retreated, the bad droop. 

I use Seek-Shot to find and attack the bad droop. I hit him and deal a decent amount of damage. He is a crafty creature though and hides where he is. 

Droop continues to hold tightly onto Arix. He holds out the healing pot that Arix gave him to Arix's mouth to heal him. 

Strya is attacked by a buggabear. He slams down his morning star on top of Strya who was unable to get his shield up in time. What an amateur. 

Arix feels revitalized from the potion. He crosses the river and rejoins the group. 

Strya punches at the buggabear but from the force of the last attack leaving her dizzy, she misses. 

Aergo moves further forward to see if she can find the bad droop. She moves out of sight. 

One of the last two buggabears moves up to Jon and attempts to attack him but Strya bops the morning star with her shield. He grunts angrily. 

I very cooly shoot him with my bow. I hit him right in the shoulder, exactly where I meant to. 

Droop from his perch on Arix's shoulder, and shoots his pelet at the buggabear, screaming as loudly as his little vocal cords can let him, and slays the buggabear I injured just for him. 

Jon attempts to shove the last buggabear off of the ledge. He windmills his arms and smacks both of them into the buggabear, pushing him back 5 feet. 

He retaliates and attempts to attack Jon but misses. 

Arix throws his sweet dagger at the buggabear but misses. 

Strya moves up to shove the buggabear again. She windmills her arms as well and smacks them into it and it falls off of the cliff. It's a small cliff and it barely injures the buggabear. 

I pick up the torch and bring it over to the cliff to get a better view of what is going on. 

Droop sticks to Arix. 

Jon moves closer to the cliff and whips the buggabear. *winky face* The bear enjoys it. He picks him up with the whip and drops him back onto the ground. 

The buggabear climbs up and attacks Jon but misses. 

Arix pulls out a torch and runs up to me and lights it on my torch then runs back out of the room screaming, "We're comming!". 

Strya moves up on the buggabear and hits it with his shield and does a moderate amount of damage. He attempts to grapples but fails. 

Aergo dashes and yells, "This way!", and falls back into the room whence she came. 

I drop the torch and shoot the buggabear. 

Droop continues to sit on Arix's shoulder. 

Jon turns himself into a wild lizard and chills. 

Arix moves up along with droop outside of my vision. 

Strya punches at the buggabear but barely misses and looks like an idiot. 

I decide to hang out and watch what Jon and Strya do. I definitely didn't shoot an arrow. 

Jon bites the buggabear and bites off it's head! 

Strya runs back the way we came. 

I follow suit. Droop comes into vision and he moves up a little ways. 

Jon moves up past me, wobbling as a lizard. 

I ask what is going on. 

bg - Why are you in such a dangerous area? 

a - Danger is relative as long as you avoid it. 

Arix picks up droop and brings him over to Jon to see if he has any more good boi points to give to Arix. Jon, as a lizard, a small frill comes out from the sides of his face. There are glistening stars on then and grants him two good boi points. 

Strya gets upset at Arix for running off on his own. I walk into the room and see an elf guy with a black spider on his staff. 

Arix asks Aergo who her friend is. 

A - you mentioned this place being dangerous. 

bg - There is danger all around in these caverns, its an old mine after all. What is your motive of being here. 

Arix there's spiderwebs in the room.

a - strickly exploring. 

bg - what treasures are you after. 

a - I'm not picky. I do favors for treasures. 

bg - I see. And what is a treasure hunter doing out here in fandolin.

a - thats the point. I like going into the unknown. thats how you dont get caught. 

bg - are you saying you're not with the town? 

a - nahhhhhhhh brahhhh

bg - what of your companions. 

a - companions? I thought you were expecting these guys? 

Arix readies a javalin. 

a - is this the danger you're speaking of? 

bg - I heard you yelling for your friends. 

a - uhhhhhh something about being deceptive and whatnot, typical Casey

Arix I think the thing pretending to be droop is now pretending to be Aergo. 

Jon - eeeeehhhhh

Aergo raises her hand to everyone at the door as jon slides into the room.

Jon climbs up to the ceiling. 

I reply to Arix and ask, "Are you sure about that?"

Arix is certain. I am inclined to believe him but I'm skeptical. I drop the torch and ready my bow. 

bg - there is no need for arguments here. 

a - they are about to attack me! they aren't my comrades. 

Jon starts walking in like he belongs here because he is a lizard in a dungeon. 

bg - what is your goal here, all of you.

Jon - bleeeee

a - I wish to live. 

bg begins to be a little untrusting. 4 large spiders fall from the ceiling. 

The dwarf starts to moves around radically. 

# THEY ATTACK! 

I am now covered in webs and have to use an action to move. I am restrained. It moves up close to me. 

The other spider shoots its webs at Strya but misses. 

Arix gets retrained as well. 

Jon almost gets retrained but manages to dodge it. 

The spider next to me attacks me and hits me for a small bit of damage. 

The spider next to Strya but misses. 

Strya moves over in front of drop and dodges. 

The dwarf moves around more violently. The Black Spider doesn't like that. 

Aergo runs down to the hallway to the right and Eldritch blasts the spider in the middle of the room and deals some damage. 

I escape the web and run from the spider. As I run, it attacks me but using my special powers, I heal the damage that it does. 

The spider from the middle of the room runs towards Aergo and misses it's bite on her. 

Jon bites at the spider next to him and nibbles on its leg. 

The spider retaliates by biting at Jon and he takes some moderate damage. 

Arix brakes free from his webs. He looks at droop and says, "Don't trust anyone you lose sight of." 

The spider moves up to Arix and snaps at him, he misses because he was blinded by all of Arix's sexy tokens he was holding. 

The spider next to Strya attacks him but misses. 

Strya stays where he is and dodges the next attack. 

Aergo disengages and moves far back. 

I shoot at the spider next to Strya and hit it. 

Droop does the help action and pretends to faints to distract the spiders. 

The spider continues to rush after Aergo and attack her. Aergo reacts with Hellish Rebuke and burns the spider dealing TONS OF DAMAGE!

Jon bites at the spider again! He takes a good chomp out of it. 

The spider shoots a web at Jon and restrains him. 

Arix swings his great axe at the spider next to him and hits it directly in the leg, damaging it greatly. 

The spider bites at Arix and poisons him. 

The spider next to Strya tries to web him but misses. Strya stands his ground and dodges yet again. 

Aergo Eldritch Blasts the spider but misses. 

I bust out an acid arrow and shoot the spider next to Strya with it. 

Droop hides behind Arix and disappears. 

The spider spews it white sticky stuff all over Aergo. 

Jon bites at the legs of the spider and munches all over those spider legs. 

The Black Spider points at Jon and does something weird to him. I can't make it out. 

The spider next to Jon moves over to Arix. 

Arix drops his great axe and takes out his sword and shield and stabs at the spider to the right of him. Arix demolishes the spider. 

The spider next to Strya attacks Arix but misses. 

Strya readies her shield and dodges yet again. 

Aergo is restrained. She pulls out her short sword and attacks the spider. The sword pierces the spider and uses some magic stuff to deal more damage to the spider. The spider is also demolished!

I completely demolish the spider next to Strya by shooting it right in the dick. 

Jon moves up to Arix and attacks him! He bites at him but misses. Arix baps him on the nose with his shield. 

The Black Spider points his staff at Strya and beams of light shoot straight at him and smack him one by one by one. Strya falls unconscious. 

The spider next to Arix attacks him and crit him but because his shiny beautiful scales, it barely does any damage. 

Arix retaliates and deals all of the damages to it. 

I shoot my bow but the Black Spider must've messed with my mind and made me shoot towards Arix but Arix dodged thankfully. 

DROOP POPS UP OUT OF NO WHERE AND SHOOTS AT THE BLACK SPIDER! He hits and deals some damage but he manages to keep his concentration on Jon. 

Jon attacks Arix again and knocks him unconscious. 

Black Spider casts Magic Missile at Jon and he deals a decent amount of damage. 

Aergo Eldritch Blasts the Black Spider and deals a moderate amount of damage. 

My arrow bounces off some magic mage armor and it doesn't effect the Black Spider. 

Droop rushes down to Arix and look between Strya and Arix and starts to panic a little. He stabilizes Arix. 

Jon turns back into a human and casts Healing Word on Arix and heals him for a decent amount of damage. 

Black Spider points his staff and blue sparks start coming out of it. It heads droop's way and it hit him. It barely does anything to him. 

Arix tries to stabilize Strya and succeeds. He moves forward towards Black Spider. 

Strya is alive but at 0 hp. Can't do anything. 

THE DWARF TURNS INTO AN ELF AND WALKS UP ON ARIX. 

Aergo casts Eldritch Blasts and misses. 

My arrow bounces off of his armor again. 

Droop faints next to Arix again. 

Jon heals up Strya like he did Arix. He then moves up and casts thunder wave on himself and hits everyone around him. Black Spider saves himself but the duplicate does not. Arix gets an attack of opportunity. He hits him and deals a decent bit of damage. 

Black Spider brings his staff up in front of him and disappears. 

Arix swings his sword at the dude and slashes the sword right across his mouth. Half of his head falls off. Arix says, "Don't impersonate my friends."

Droop Claps. 

Strya moves up and stands next to droop. He uses Divine Sense to try and detect the Black Spider. He sense nothing. 

Aergo tries to unlock the door next to her but fails. 

Droop is waiting on Arix. 

Jon casts detect magic to see if he can find Black Spider. He moves down a bit and uses Thunder Wave. 

The Black Spider is revealed. He uses Shocking Grasp and tries to touch Jon. Jon dodges the attack. 

Arix moves up on the Black Spider and swings his sword at him. He attacks recklessly and misses. He puts up a shield around him.

Strya runs at him and attempts to punch him. He misses. 

Aergo uses Eldritch Blast but misses. 

I shoot at him but he is too powerful and the shield makes me miss. 

Droop curses at the Black Spider. 

Jon attacks him and deals TONS OF DAMAGE. He brings his magical blade down on the Black Spider and he falls to the ground. He is engulfed in flame. He is burnt to a crisp. He falls to the ground in a pile of ash. 

I search for arrows.
