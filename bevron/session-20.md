We start off in the room where we killed the man with the spider staff. 

I didn't find any salvageable arrows. 

Arix - Why were you trying to make friends with the Black Spider, Aergo

Aergo - How many times have I tried to deceive you guys? I was in a room with a bad guy that was trying to kill me. 

Arix - The other droop was able to act exactly like our droop. 

Aergo - I went straight for loot right after the fight. 

Bevron - Ask her something that only  she would know. 

Arix - We don't know if she gained her memories. 

Aergo attempts to get close to droop but Arix gets in her way. She ends up throwing some meat to her. 

Droop grabs ahold of the meat and snacks on it. He splits it in two and gives half to Arix but he doesn't eat it. 

Strya - I understand what's been happening in this dungeon, but you're being a bit over the top. 

Arix - well we just need to kill her to see if she transforms. 

Me - I don't think that's a good idea. 

Arix - Why not? 

Me - Because she might not be the other doppelganger.

There was a big argument here. 

Arix - until we can be sure, I don't want you rifling through anything. Bevron you go check. 

I move up to rummage through the desk. On the desk, there is a lot of papers strewn about. A lot of the writting was illegible but there is a black sack on the table. I go through the sack. It opens and clanks but inside there is 225 gold pieces, 15 platinum, 9 gems, and a Dwarven mug made from electrum. 

Me - Hey guys, there's a bunch of gold in this sack.

I hold onto the fat sack of mullah. 

Droop convinces Arix that Aergo that she is a friend. Aergo throws an apple, gently, at Arix. 

Arix - I'd say if you step out of line, I'd kill you, but you always step out of line. 

I cannot read anything on the table as it is in another language. 

Aergo finds a key that's head is shaped like an anvil admits the ashes. 

Strya attempts to open the door but it is locked. Arix checks the statue for a keyhole. Arix knows who the statue is. The dwarven god of mining. Strya is yelling. 

I ready my bow incase something bad is behind the locked door. Strya quietly opens the door. 

As we enter, it is dusty and has a bed and brazier. There is an unconscious dwarf on the floor. There is nothing else of interest. 

Strya checks to see if he is stable. He is. Strya also has the chalk. We lock the door behind us and take a long rest. 

I take first watch while Strya prays over Nundro, the dwarf. 

Arix decides to tie the rope from the doorknob to the bed. 

I feel the tiredness creeping up on me but I shrug it off and stay awake just fine. I hear moaning outside of the door. I creep over towards Arix to try and quietly wake him up to see if he can hear. he is confused and i give up on him. 

I go to Strya to see if I can see if she can hear what's going on outside of the door. 

This party sucks massive penis. 

I tell Arix to just go back to sleep. I go to sleep and let someone else take their watch. 

# Roll Initiative

I'm still napping. 

Droop is also napping. 

The jelly looks at Arix and attempts to attack him. It hits Arix and he takes some damage. 

Aergo hears the sounds of an attack and see the giant jelly in the room. She grabs a dagger and throws it at the jelly. It hits. 

Jon wakes up and whips the jelly. *gigga winky face*. It takes some damage. 

Arix pulls out his sword and shield and hits the jelly with tons of damage. The jelly splits in two. He spits on the jelly right in front of him. 

Strya wakes up during the fight. She equips her shield and uses sacred weapon and thats it. 

I heard the screaming and wake up! I ready my bow and shoot the jelly. I'm so fucking awesome. 

Droop shoots his sling shot but misses. 

A jelly swings at Jon but misses. 

The other jelly swings at Arix but also misses. 

Aergo uses eldritch blast on the nearest jelly and hits. 

Jon hits the jelly nearest him with the whip. 

Arix swings his sword from the side and hits the jelly and splits it into two.

Strya hits the one in front of Arix with his shield. It pops apart in an unpleasant sound. 

I shoot my bow at the jelly and it pops again very loudly into nothing. 

Droop shoots his pellet at the last jelly and deals a little bit of damage. 

Aergo blasts the Jelly and it explodes. 

# Battle over

Strya pours water on the acid on the rope. 

Aergo uses a potion on Nundro and heals him. He wakes up. 

I'm able to collect about half a healing potion jarful of the jelly. Aergo gives me a second empty jar. 

Aergo starts talking with Nundro. Nundro hasn't seen his brother in a while. Arix is passed out on the floor with Droop. 

The rest of the night passes uneventfully. 

Aergo invites Nundro along with our party as we attempt to find his brothers. 

I tell everyone about the moaning that I heard during the night and Strya tells them about the zombies. 

Jon helps Nundro off of the bed and starts walking him towards the door. 

We head out of the room and don't encounter anything initially. Aergo stealths on ahead to see if she can find anything. 

We head down and cross over the river. Aergo jumps across the water and climbs the cliff on the other side along with Strya. 

Droop is having the time of his life on Arix's shoulder in the water. 

Strya helps me and Droop up onto the cliff. 

We continue on through the caves. 

We enter a room with a big pool of water. The big waves slam into the wall of the cave. 

The water level is scarily high. We continue to venture forth through the room. The water is very dark and hard to see into. There is a split in the path. We take the southern one. It turns out to be a dead end so we head back and take the eastern path. 

We come upon a door. Strya attempts to open it. It is a badly wounded door. It is jammed. She uses her shield to bash the doorknob. She smashes the door and it crumbles in on itself. It looks like the room was once a workshop but it's old and rusty. Nothing looks useful. 

There is a second door in the room. Strya moves into the room and approaches said door. I hang back with my bow ready. She opens the door and goes into the room. There is a floating spherical thing that has 5 eyes. I attempt to use my acid in the bottle on an arrow. 

Arix peeks in through the door. 

Arix - Ok guys, it's talking to me but it's mouth isn't moving. 

Arix goes back in and thinks back hello really hard. It's stares blankly and goes back to work. Arix walks in and looks around the room. 

Arix - Do you need help with anything? 

thing - do you work in the mines? 

Arix - no

Strya, covering Arix's mouth - Yes

Aergo attempts to convince it that we all work here in the mine. 

She seems to convince it that we are workers here. 

Thing - I protect these mines. 

Strya - can I see what you're working on? 

The thing just appears to be searching through his things for something. 

The spherical creature continues to ignore Arix. Arix picks something up and it eyes Arix up but doesn't do anything. 

Arix - We are just going to take this wrench and go. 

As we start walking away, it turns towards Arix and it starts screaming in our minds.
