talk to Qelline at Aldarleef, Daran Edermaff, town master, shrine 

We had a full breakfast and we got praise for getting rid of the Ruffians. 

How tall is droop? 3’2”

The inn keeper says that the hasn’t seen any dwarves except for the minor’s exchange. 

I head to the shrine with Aergo and Arix. It is dedicated to Temora(?). There is a young, female elf praying. Aergo is going for some beaver again. 

Aergo is getting chummy with the Elf. 

The elf has a mission. Agatha, there is a banshee outside of town that needs dealing with. she is said to know much about this world. we need to take a spellbook to her. We need to bring a jeweled silver comb to give to the banshee. Ask for the location of the spell book. the book is owned by Bo Gentle. North East, 2 Days travel. We get a map from her. She will bless us when we finish this task.

We meet up with wet leaf who is chatting with someone named Duran.  

He doesn’t know anything about Wave Echo Cave. There is dangerous magic happening east outside of town. We got a rough estimate of where Old Owl Well is, about a 2 days travel. Undead, the redead, stuff is happening. 

Banshee’s are vulnerable to arrows. Considered undead. 

THIS IS THE APPLE ORCHARD. WE GROW ORANGES. 

The average lifespan of the halfing is around 150 years. 

We head to a field nearby. There is an older lady halfling that is working out in the fields. 

Her name is Alderleaf. She says: There was a Kragmaw castle. 

Raydoth might know about the castle. Long time friend. An adventurer. He is in a village named Thundertree. A tough friend of her. Works alone. He just set out for Thundertree. She gives us a rough estimate written on a map. North West of us, close to Never Winter. 

Aergo hits droop in the head with an apple on purpose. 

Arix throws his half of an apple at Aergo. 

Aergo throws 5 illusionary apples that are on fire at Arix. Arix actually believes this is happening. He tries to dodge and barely does it in time. He trips and is now dirty. 

It’s still before midday. 

We decided to head North East after the healing potions are ready. We decided to go after the banshee. 

We are going to wait for the health potions to finish brewing. I’m going to an archery range to practice archery. I get an advantage the next time I fight from my training. 

We go to sleep. 

We head out for the banshees place. We make camp after a day’s travel. I take second watch. 

I’m sleeping and have to roll initiative. A group of goblins are attacking us.  Aergo’s flute woke us up as she puts two of the goblins to sleep. Aergo turns a goblin into flames and he dies. 

DROOP IS FIGHTING WITH US! 

I deal tons of damage with my bow and kill one of the goblins. 

Other people are doing things, doesn’t really matter to be honest. 

I didn’t miss a single shot this fight. I’m so fucking good. Fight over. 

We go back to sleep and nothing happens for the rest of the night. 

Wet leaf just slaps the fire out of existence. 

It gets harder to travel. The bushes are getting thicker. 

Night comes and the night goes by uneventfully. 

We start walking and find a sign that says “Connie” or “Berry”. 

We make it to a ruined village that is very overgrown by nature.
