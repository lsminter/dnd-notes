We break into the taproom and I open the door for the rest of us. Make our way through the house. 

We chase the bad guy out the back for a long time. (too long)

There was an insane gust of wind that made my perfectly shot arrow go off course. It was completely out of my control and there was absolutely nothing I could’ve done. The wind won’t stop randomly blowing every time I shoot my arrows. 

I decided to let someone else do something and kill the bad guy. 

I search, got nothing. 

Sildar comes to us and is happy that I killed the bad guys but the town master is unhappy that “trouble” is being caused. (There are still people from the gang somewhere). His friend has gone missing. 

Sildar has joined the party. Iarno Albrek is Sildar’s friend that we are searching for. 

Aergo sneaks into the manor using the red cape. 

We go into the manor and search the downstairs. 

We find three bad guys in a small room. I rolled a 21 on initiative. Everyone else is inferior. 

I did tons of damage. All of the damage to the bad guys. Why does no one ever help me? 

I grab a red cloak from the wall along with the others. There is a red cloak in my inventory. Don’t forget about the red cloak. 

We are still in the basement.
