We wake up in the inn. 

We head to Barthon’s to possibly buy a potion depending on what is there. 

We go into the mansion. Moist cabbage slips going up the stairs like a doofas and takes damage. 

The wet leaf falls down the stairs again and knocks out a floor board. The fucking idiots that I have to deal with. 

We see Aergo fall down a GAPING hole. We see feet. That is all we see. There is nothing else to see but her feet from the fall from the top of the stairs to the FIRST floor. 

Sildar’s friend’s name is… OH MY GOODNESS… I believe its Iarno Albrek.

We head downstairs and I roll the highest out of everyone to get across the pit. 

Sillydar falls into the pit and takes tons of damage. He loses my rope. I expertly climb down into it and get my rope and climb back out just using my feet. 

We head through the coffin room and go past the prison room into a small room. 

There is a metal door that is locked. The dragon breaks the door open. There are tons of weapons. 

Apparently a normal person cannot carry more than three quivers. I have to hide my true abilities and only go with three even though I could easily go with 8 total quivers. 

I also grab a crossbow. 

Sildar finds a secret door and opens it. Kawamori goes through the door. 
 
We go through and Aergo go completely invisible and no one can see her. We wait for a scream, or a shit or a fuck. In that order. 
 
As we walk around, we find a Nothic. Usually untrusted. One giant eye. It is there to keep an EYE out. 
 
Aergo throws a dagger stealthily at it. It screams in each of our minds. 
 
ROLL INITIATIVE
 
The whole bridge shattered and Arix falls into the crevice. 
 
Ryann has loaded dice. 
 
ARIX PULLS OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE AND JUMPS ACROSS THE PIT AND GRAPLES THE BEAST! He does 3 damage… 
 
Arix pulls off the biggest coolest swing of his great axe and kills the beast!
 
Really wish that Casey did more damage. I did a lot. 

There are no bolts… or arrows…
