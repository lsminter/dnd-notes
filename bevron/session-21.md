## Start of fight 

I coat my arrow with the acid jelly and shoot it at the spherical thingamabob. It hit it and dealt tons of damage. 

Droop misses his attack. 

The moon boy decides to just hang out. 

The ball shoots a burst of light at Arix. Oh no! Arix is confused. A black beam jumps from Arix to me and I take a large hit. 

Arix throws the wrench just away from himself. It hits me in the face, the dumb fuck. This guy is literally trying to kill me. Jon take the chance to attack the ball while it was attacking me and whips it. 

Strya lights his shield on fire and hit the ball with his shield. The ball turns on fire. 

Aergo attempts to put it to sleep but decides to put her sleep spell on the OTHER SIDE OF THE FUCKING WALL! It does nothing. 

I shoot it with my bow and heal myself. 

Droop shoots the fire for some reason. 

Jon just hangs out. 

The ball puts out the flames all 4 of the tentacles pop off and go towards Jon. Strya attempts to hit Jon with his shield for some reason and he bursts into flames. I'm unsure why this is. Jon takes a ton of damage and is on fire now. 

Strya defends herself from the ball. I somehow get shot with another black bolt of whatever. 

Arix rages and shoots a lightning bolt through the fire at the ball. The ball takes a little bit of damage. 

Strya misses her attack. 

Aergo pulls out a dagger and attempts to stab it in the back. She misses. It warbles out of Aergo's attack. For her bonus action she gives me some bonus action. 

I shoot my bow at the sphere. I hit it again and do a fuck ton of damage. I'm too fucking good at this thing. It's so easy. If only people were as good as me then no one would ever be in danger. 

One of the eyes turns to Aergo and absolutely nothing happens. 

I TAKE MORE DAMAGE FOR SOME DUMB ASS REASON.

Arix attempts to jump over the fire to attack the ball with his sword. He flips over and lands on his back and is laying on the ground. He stands up. 

Strya attempts to hit the ball but misses. 

Aergo attempts to stab it in one of eyes. She connects and deals a very small amount of damage. I'm so much better. 

I shoot at it with my bow. I miss. All this damage I've taken because of others makes me miss. 

The ball makes Aergo take a ton of damage. Aergo uses infernal rebuke as a reaction and the ball reflects the damage onto Strya. Strya takes a little bit of damage.

Arix rages from the sexual feelings and attempts to grab the ball but since he is confused, tries to grab Strya. He hurts himself in his confusion. 

Strya attempts to hit it with his shield but misses. 

Aergo tries to heat up the metal in its eye ball. Aergo jumps up onto its head and the ball bursts into flames. It screeches in our minds. It burns into ashe. 

## end fight with the ball

Arix puts his hand in the fire for some reason. He just keeps hurting himself on it. 

I pick up the wrench and hit him in the arm with it. I toss him a jar. He uses the jar to attempt to catch the fire. Nothing happens. He puts some coals in the fire. 

Aergo searches the tables for stuff. There is a mace and there is a breastplate. The breastplate was made for a great hero long ago. It is old but still holding strong. 

We move out. We come upon a door and I ready my bow and arrow. Jon tries opening but it doesn't work. He then pulls it. It opens. 

(I don't see this happening) Inside there is a creature. He comes up from the floor. We hear it talk but it's mouth isn't moving. 

## Roll initiative 

The ghosty thing rolls up on Strya and attacks her. Strya is completely knocked out and is lying on the floor. 

Arix runs up and shoves the ghost away from Strya and rages. It attacks back. 

Aergo shrugs and walks up and swings it at the dude. She misses. 

Droop runs up to Strya and pulls her back 5 feet. 

Jon turns into a bear and attacks the ghost. He deals a ton of damage. 

I use seek shot and hit the bad guy with all my might. 

Strya gets up off of the floor and moves up behind Arix. She says, "God give us strength". She casts bless on her, Arix, Aergo, and Jon. 

Arix pulls out his sword and shield. He attempts to stab it with his long sword. He misses but he feels hit weird radiant shit flow through him but recoils and still misses.

Jon attempts to save himself from the necrotic damage. It moves through Jon and Arix. 

Aergo moves up and swings her mace at it and misses. 

Droop misses his attack. 

Jon bites at the ghost and misses. He then uses a claw attack and hits. 

I shoot my bow and deal all of the damages. I'm too good at this game. 

Strya punches it with her shield. She hits it with divine smite. 

Arix recklessly attacks it and deals a ton of damage. He fucking walks through it with his sword, lightning and all. It's form bursts into a light and it dissipates. 

## fight over
I find some arrows. 

The bear found something and put it in his mouth. The bear turns back into a human. 

We take a short rest. 

There is a chest full of coinage. I get 157 copper and silver and 21 gold.

I split up the loot I got from the bag with everyone. 

After our short rest, Aergo checks din the room next to ours to see what's in there. She only found papers. 

Nundro knows nothing about the mushrooms in the cave. 

We move north to escape from the cave. 

## Roll initiative

I take a step back once I hear a loud screech. 

Jon produces a flame in his hand and moves up next to Aergo and Strya. 

# MEGALOVANIA STARTS PLAYING

Aergo critical strikes the zombie. It's hurting a decent bit. 

Strya moves up next to the zombie and attacks. 

Droop moves up and hangs out. Arix dashes up next to the zombie. 

Something shoots a gigantic fireball through the tunnel burning everything in it's path. Lot's of people are hurt badly. 

I move up to banish the demon that is shooting fireballs but due to the heat from the cave, it moves my arrow and it misses.

Jon picks up Droop and retreats. 

The zombies move closer. 

Aergo dips the fuck out. 

Strya attacks the zombie then runs away. 

Arix yells, "Get Droop to safety!" He dodges all the attacks that come his way. 

Three zombies are surrounding him.
